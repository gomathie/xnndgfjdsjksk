                People say that opposites attract and this can be true 
                for elements of design as well. Imagine a composition 
                without contrast –every color, font, shape, etc. 
                would be the same size, and that design would be rather dull.
                Contrast is the tool that makes a design “pop,” making it 
                memorable for viewers.
                Contrast also aids in the usability of a composition. 
                A design’s organization is dependent upon how contrast is used to 
                lead a viewer’s eye towards what is most important.

            <h3>Proximity</h3>

                When designers move elements closer together or farther 
                apart, they are employing the principle of proximity. 
                There are two major reasons why a designer would employ 
                proximity: to create connections or deploy them. 
                When we view elements of design near each other within a composition, 
                we perceive those elements as related. By placing elements away from 
                one another, a designer is able to convey that there is no relationship
                between them. The relationship between elements creates relevancy, organization, structure, and hierarchy.

            <h3>Alignment</h3>

                Although alignment is typically overlooked, 
                without this tool a design would lack a sense of 
                direction, unity, or organization. Alignment simply 
                refers to how elements are placed on a page. 
                Its purpose goes beyond organization, it is vital for enhancing
                 the overall visual appeal of a design or page layout.
